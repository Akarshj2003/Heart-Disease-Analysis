# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a heart disease dataset using popular data science libraries including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The script reads data from a CSV file, performs various analyses such as data summary statistics, correlation analysis, and generates visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.


Objective:

The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the heart disease dataset and understand the factors that may be associated with the presence or absence of heart disease. By performing data exploration, summary statistics, correlation analysis, and generating visualizations, we aim to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This analysis can potentially provide valuable information for further research or interventions related to heart health.
